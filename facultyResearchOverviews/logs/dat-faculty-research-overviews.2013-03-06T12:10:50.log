    <core:researchOverview>My research interests span two primary areas: stereotyping and intergroup relations, and person perception and impression formation. Recent work in the stereotyping domain includes the role of race in decisions to shoot armed and unarmed targets, and in particular how expertise can facilitate cognitive control over such decisions. A second line concerns implicit role associations between women and childrearing, and men and work. We argue well-learned implicit cultural associations increase the likelihood that professionally trained women will leave their positions when tensions between work and family responsiblities become too great, and decrease the likelihood that men will make these tradeoffs. A third area concerns ideologies towards interethnic interactions and the conditions under which these can facilitate versus harm interethnic relations. My research in person perception concerns impression formation regarding traits, attitudes and values, specifically in the political domain.</core:researchOverview>

River channel adjust to long-term varaitions in flow and sediment supply. Human activities, such as the construction of reservoirs, that alter the existing flow regime and/or the supply of sediment will cause an adjustment in the affected river channel. Frequently, the channel adjustment will have undesirable impacts on the aquatic and riparian resources.

    <core:researchOverview>Dr. Heathwood's principle research area is ethics, where his work divides mainly into welfare and metaethics.  Theories of welfare answer the question, What makes a person‚Äôs life go well for him or her?  Most of Dr. Heathwood‚Äôs work on welfare pertains to desire-based answers to this question, views according to which getting a good life is, in some way or other, a matter of getting things one wants.  Relatedly, Dr. Heathwood also defends desire-based theories of the nature of pleasure and pain.  In metaethics, which is the study of the most fundamental issues in ethics, such as whether value is objective or subjective, Dr. Heathwood has written on the nature of value, the nature of reasons for action, the relation of the latter to desire-based theories of welfare and pleasure, and on grounding moral facts.

    <core:researchOverview>Prof. Kapteyn's research is in developing, and putting to use, techniques for generating coherent x-rays using tabletop-scale laser technology. Contemporary laser technlogy, much of which was developed by the group of Prof. Kapteyn and Prof. Margaret Murnane, makes it possible to generate light pulses of terawatt (10^12 W) or higher peak power, in a flash of light only 10 femtoseconds (10^-14 sec) in duration, using a tabletop laser setup. The interaction of this intense light with atoms and molecules upconverts some of the incident light into a coherent beam of light at much higher frequencies, in effect creating for the first time a tabletop x-ray laser source that generates extremely short bursts. Much of the technology for doing this was also developed in the Kapteyn/Murnane lab, and they have also used this new capability for novel research investigating dynamic processes in atoms, molecules, and materials.</core:researchOverview>

A unifying theme of our studies is the question of how plants survive and thrive in their natural environment and what mechanisms (and genes) are responsible for the acclimation and adaptation of plants to extreme environmental conditions. We compare and contrast these characteristics among plant species with different growth patterns and acclimation strategies, and include both anatomical/morphological and physiological features.  In addition, we have recently begun to apply our expertise of the regulation of photosynthetic efficiency and photosynthetic capacity to algae in order to maximize photosynthesis and productivity for the efficient generation of energy-rich molecules that can be used in the synthesis of biofuels.</core:researchOverview>

In setting up the prosodic domains within which T3S applies, syntax is partially referred to. Cyclic and non-cyclic parsing strategies are used for different syntactic contexts. A non-cyclic strategy is used for flat structures (e.g. digit sequences), a cyclic strategy for noun phrases, and a mixture of both strategies is necessary for sentences. There is also T3S variability because of T3S optional rules. Such variability creates ambiguity in the language input for children. Very little is known about how children acquire T3S.

    <core:researchOverview>My research concerns pedagogy in science labs.  I am examining the impacts of individual variations in student working memory on student performance and learning in different formats of inquiry-oriented science labs.  More specifically, inquiry-oriented science labs that are front-loaded, place a heavy cognitive burden on the students at the beginning of lab, in that they need to induce a hypothesis or design an investigation.  In contrast, inquiry-oriented science labs that are back-loaded, such as expository or verification lab styles, reduce cognitive load at the beginning of lab through guidance.  As a result, individual variations in working memory capacity or explanatory style may impact student learning.  Utilizing this framework, I predict students with large working memory capacities and positive explanatory styles will excel in front-loaded situations, whereas students with smaller working memory capacity and negative explanatory style will excel in a back-loaded situation.</core:researchOverview>

He has also discussed an epistemology of experiment, a set of strategies that provide rational belief in experimental  results. These strategies distinguish between a valid experimental result and an artifact created by the experimental  apparatus.

The lab always aims for important questions in relatively unexplored areas and encourages researchers to generate their own ideas. In early 90s, the lab focused on identifying critical regulators of the RTK-RAS-MAP kinase signaling, and then extended effort to tackling genetic redundancy by structurally unrelated genes, and analyzing the mechanism/functions of miRNAs using systematic methods. In the late 90s, some researchers moved to study cellular/morphogenesis events during development, including identifying the SUN-KASH NE complexes and their functions. In 00s, from their efforts in human disease studies, the lab recognized that the connection between lipid metabolism and development was an important but wide-open field.

    <core:researchOverview>My group studies the mechanism of polycistronic pre-mRNA processing in C. elegans.  It used to be thought that operons, multiple genes assembled into a single transcription unit, were restricted to bacteria.  However, we discovered several years ago that the nematode, C. elegans, had operons scattered throughout its genome.  Since then, operons have been discovered in numerous animal phyla.  It seems that operons develop wherever SL-type trans-splicing has arisen. SL-type trans-splicing, which we have also studied extensively, is a variant of regular splicing (intron removal) in which a short leader replaces the outron at the 5' end of the pre-mRNA.  In polycistronic transcription units, trans-splicing is used to separate the long precursor into single-gene mature mRNAs.  My group is studying how that process works, with special attention to how the trans-splicing event, using a specialized spliced leader, is coordinated with 3' end formation just upstream.</core:researchOverview>

    <core:researchOverview>Microbial infections can be broadly categorized as acute or chronic. Chronic infections cause slow, progressive tissue damage over months to years, even decades. Accumulated damage shortens life span and predisposes the host to otherwise non-pathogenic microbes. The study of chronic infection is inherently slow and technically complicated, in part because it can be difficult to distinguish host responses that are damaging from those that are beneficial.  However, the prevalence of chronic infections has skyrocketed with increasing life spans, the rise of antibiotic resistant microbes, and increasing numbers of people with severely compromised immune systems.  There is a dearth of effective therapies for chronic infections due to our poor understanding of the relevant host-pathogen interactions. My laboratory focuses on establishing how a bacterial pathogen resists and adapts to the mammalian immune system, and how the immune system tolerates a pathogen long term.</core:researchOverview>

Gene expression during tooth development is compared in several species of fishes differing in the location, shape and number of teeth. Gene expression differences that correlate with differences in dentition are used as entry points into the genetic and developmental pathways that have been modified during the evolution of teeth. Transgenic methods are used to identify the DNA changes responsible for expression differences among species and the functional consequences of these changes. Similar experimental approaches are being used to investigate the evolution of additional morphological features of fishes such as barbels ('whiskers'), fins and scales.</core:researchOverview>

Using mirrors, lights, and found materials, I create a rudimentary bitmapping of data. This primitive and low-tech approach replicates the complexity of electronics, like a cathode ray tube or an integrated circuit, with the make shift means of the everyday. Compounded blips of light and color attempt to create a raster image similar to that transmitted in a computer or a television. The inherent inability of mechanical-era ingenuity to simulate atomic-era technology results in an abstraction of futility.

We have used powerful conditional ‚Äúgene knockout‚Äù techniques involving the cre/lox recombinase system to create mice that lack neurotrophic factors only in a specific tissue. This allows us to dissect functions in a specific tissue and/or at a specific developmental stage. We have focused primarily on the neurotrophin BDNF, and have shown that it is important in stabilizing the dendritic structure of neurons. Interestingly, this may relate to a requirement for BDNF in the formation or stabilization of many synapses. We have also identified compelling parallels between BDNF deprivation and Parkinson‚Äôs and Huntington‚Äôs diseases and are pursuing further studies using our BDNF mutant mice to identify useful targets in treating these diseases.</core:researchOverview>

    <core:researchOverview>My research group currently has three paths of inquiry, all related by our group's ability measure and characterize air quality and the associated impacts. The path of inquiry that we are most heavily engaged in is the collection and characterization of airborne particulate matter (PM) followed by the subsequent use of the measurements to drive epidemiological research; we are trying to understand which sources of PM are causing the mortality and morbidity. A second path of inquiry involves developing the next generation of tools that can be used to assess a person's exposure to harmful air pollutants.  The most recently found path involves using our PM measurement skills in the realm of solar energy harvesting.  PM deposition onto solar energy collection technology significantly impacts the efficiency of that technolgy, so our group is digging into the processes of deposition onto solar panels and of reduced solar energy transmission through the deposited PM.</core:researchOverview>

    <core:researchOverview>Ferguson‚Äôs research interests engage two broad areas of political theory: democratic and feminist theory. Her contributions to democratic theory aim at the development of a post-foundationalist account of democracy. Post-foundationalists theorize democracy in the absence of guarantees that historically have grounded democratic politics:  an appeal to God, to reason, or to human nature. Each of these foundations has been discredited in modern times. While many contemporary democratic theorists search for new sources of stability, post-foundationalists accept the instability of foundations as the condition of politics.   Ferguson‚Äôs contributions to feminist theory focus on reflections on feminism as a social movement that has only partially transformed gendered power relations in the U.S. and around the world. She analyzes how feminist ideas have successfully pervaded political discourse, why they have been successful, and why despite this success, gender equality remains elusive.</core:researchOverview>

Beyond the obvious differences where period costumes are concerned, theatrical costumes need to be constructed in durable but lightweight manner to evoke character, while enduring multiple performances and unusual activity present in theatrical production (sword fighting, extreme choreography, flying).    Furthermore, creation of character via fabric requires knowledge of physics as it relates to fibers, weaves and the way that fabrics react to gravity and mold over the body.  For example, cotton is a very common fiber from which fabric is made, but comes in numerous styles:  denims, coutils, jersey knits, corduroys, sateens, etc.  Each of these fabrics react very differently to gravity and mold the body in very disparate manners.</core:researchOverview>

In addition to operatic performance, I work passionately toward an ever-increasing expertise in vocal pedagogy and teaching of all voice classifications. Given that I am a lyric tenor, I have a natural expertise for young and advanced tenors, however, I have applied for the prestigious NATS Master Teacher Intern program, scheduled for summer, 2011.

Since the advent of generative linguistics in the 1950s, creativity has been used to refer not to a human faculty but rather to a property of the so-called generative engine, a mechanism that can produce an infinite set of sentences using a finite set of symbols (words) and a finite set of rules of combination (syntax). Dr. Michaelis tries to put humans back into grammatical picture by focusing on what they do best: exploiting the expressive potentials of forms. In particular, she studies how humans adapt grammatical routines to solve commonly encountered communicative problems and how they change the ordinary affordances of words and constructions in the service of wit and verbal dexterity.</core:researchOverview>

    <core:researchOverview>Ms. Randall's research is articulated through her life-long study of dance and her newer pursuits of film. Unique in their modes of expression, her performance, choreography, directing, and screenwriting all serve her over-arching goal to examine, reconsider, and rewrite roles for women on the stage, the screen, and the street. Using the feminist idea of the 'personal is political' as her North Star, she navigates her own intimate narrative, looking for salient images and characters to mine for the physical and metaphoric content of her work. Most recently, through her feature dance film, 'Leading Ladies,' which she co-wrote, co-directed, co-choreographed, and co-produced, Randall hopes to examine and transform roles for women through the medium of popular culture, dance, and comedy.</core:researchOverview>

Therefore, he recently initiated collaborative projects that employ techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related potentials to identify the neural substrates that play a role in these disorders.

During 2010, a paper was published on how cooperation and noncooperation by local governments over federal grants alters the choices of local elected officials in seeking to run for lateral offices rather than for federal office. During the fall election, working with a team of undergraduate and graduate students, he fielded a 3rd round of surveys of candidates for office in five states.  These surveys are providing the underlying data for a book project. The second trajectory examines the relationship between residential mobility and local politics that exist in communities.

    <core:researchOverview>As a primate ecologist, I am interested in how habitat change affects the behavior and the biology of Madagascar primates. While Madagascar is one of the top eight global hotspots in terms of biodiversity and ongoing habitat loss, little information exists regarding how these primate populations directly respond to forest degradation, fragmentation, nor the role that human actions play. In 2003, I began a long-term project on wild ring-tailed lemurs that focuses on understanding how both immediate and long term environmental factors, such as climate and anthropogenic change affect Malagasy primate behavior and biology. Key components of my long-term research project include monitoring health and population dynamics yearly.

Our work has identified conserved components of centrosomes, as well as conserved regulators and regulatory mechanisms for their assembly. While the SPB in yeast contains several widely conserved centrosome components, it lacks centrioles and thus lacks components required to assemble centrioles (and basal bodies). In order to identify and analyze proteins specific to centrioles/basal bodies we study basal bodies in the ciliate Tetrahymena, a tractable microbial system. Finally, we use human tissue culture cells to study centrosomes.

The cosmological model, predicated on denial of Einstein's unjustified 1916 assumption that energy produces gravity, explains these dark entities as aspects of Ellis' 1973 singularity-free and horizonless 'drainholes' (aka 'traversable wormholes', featured in the book and film 'Contact' by Carl Sagan as shortcuts to distant parts of the universe).  The model predicts a 'big bounce' (not a 'bang'), early-stage inflation, and late-stage acceleration, and provides excellent fits to astronomical observations.

Our major contributions have been as follows. First, we identified the major pathways of mRNA turnover in eukaryotes, which initiates with poly(A) tail shortening and then either triggers 3' to 5' degradation of the mRNA body, or decapping, leading to 5' to 3' exonucleolysis. Second, we identified many of the major nucleases of mRNA degradation and their regulators including the decapping enzyme, the 3' to 5' decay complexes, and the deadenylases. Third, we have provided evidence that decapping and translation initiation are in competition and that many of the factors promoting decapping do so by interfering with translation initiation.

Employing shotgun proteomics, Boswell identified over 50 proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with the EJC in extracts of ovarian tissues.

Since 1986, I have conducted interdisciplinary archaeological and paleoenvironmental research in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. I use poststructural theories of practice and power to examine sociopolitical change in ancient Oaxaca. I also investigate the 4000 year history of human impact on the environment along the R??o Verde drainage basin of Oaxaca. My field research includes archaeological excavation and survey in the lower R??o Verde Valley along the Pacific coast as well as geological and paleoecological research along the entire drainage basin.</core:researchOverview>

    <core:researchOverview>Research in the Espinosa lab falls under two labels: 1) Mechanisms of Gene Expression Control, and 2) Cancer Biology. The first label sounds like pure basic science, dealing with the fundamental processes by which gene activity is regulated to satisfy the ever-changing needs of the cell. The second label sounds very applicable to human health. In reality, both aspects of this research program blend into a pluripotent scientific endeavor. The overall idea is that human cancer is a disease of aberrant gene expression, where tumor cells display too little activity of some genes and too much of others. Such aberrant gene expression allows cancer cells to break free from the social rules imposed on individual cells within a multicellular organism and endows them with malignant properties. We reason that understanding how gene expression is imbalanced in cancer cells will enable the design of prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic tools.</core:researchOverview>

Enzymes in metabolic pathways are superb catalysts, accelerating chemical reactions by up to 16 orders of magnitude. Many enzymes also catalyze adventitious secondary reactions, simply because active sites are loaded with highly reactive acids, bases, nucleophiles, metal ions, and cofactors. Although these ‚Äúpromiscuous‚Äù activities are inefficient, they provide a repertoire of activities that can be drawn upon if conditions change and catalysis of a secondary reaction becomes important for fitness.  Projects in the lab seek to identify biochemical and physiological factors that influence the potential for evolution of novel activities from promiscuous enzymes.

    <core:researchOverview>Professor Nielsen is currently engaged in a study of the effects of experiential learning/teaching in sociology of environment classes at the university level.  Specifically, the project compares involvement in environmentally-related activities outside the classroom with paradigm-changing  classics such as 'Ishmael' in terms of what Bell calls 'phenomenological ruptures.'  Phenomenological ruptures in this context are defined as abrupt changes in and/or discontinuance of taken-for-granted assumptions about the relation between humans and their environments.    Professor Nielsen is also working on a new theoretical synthesis of her gender norm violation papers that have been published over the years.</core:researchOverview>

    <core:researchOverview>The research of the Jimenez group centers on the development and application of advanced instrumentation for real-time, quantitative measurements of the size, chemical composition, and morphology of submicron aerosols. We care about atmospheric aerosols for many reasons, including their effect on radiation balance (climate forcing), severe short-term and long-term effects on human health, reduced visibility, and deposition of acids, toxics, and nutrients to ecosystems and crops. Most of these effects are not well understood, in good part due to the limitations of the instrumentation available. Advanced instrumentation can be used to make much faster progress in many of these areas. Aerosols are also important for other applications such as nanomaterials fabrication and pharmaceutical drug delivery.</core:researchOverview>

She explores political and social change through key literary, and to some extent also, artistic works of this period, examining the questions they raise of the freedom of the writer to challenge the status quo, to effect political and social change, to find new forms of expression for new forms of political and cultural power.    She is also interested in reception studies, in particular in the large body of works by the Augustan poet Ovid (43BCE-17CE), probably the most consistently influential Roman author in the western tradition.</core:researchOverview>

His current research focuses on 3 areas:     1)  Astrophysical reconnection in high-energy-density radiative plasmas ---  a new frontier in magnetic reconnection research pioneered by Prof. Uzdensky. A specific application is to understand giant magnetar flares and gamma-ray bursts.     2)  Newly-discovered highly dynamic plasmoid-dominated regime of magnetic reconnection in large systems. Prof. Uzdensky  pioneered a novel statistical theoretical approach to this regime predicting plasmoid distribution; the key findings of this theory were subsequently confirmed by numerical simulations.    3)  Relativistic pair reconnection in pulsar magnetospheres, winds, and pulsar wind nebulae.     Prof. Uzdensky also works on accretion disks and their coronae, and on reconnection in relativistic jets of AGN, e.g., blazars.</core:researchOverview>
